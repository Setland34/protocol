# Becoming a Reviewer

To become a reviewer, you need to be proficient in event interpretations. Only EI super users have access to review.

### Steps to Join the Reviewer Community

1. **Visit the Event Interpretation Guide**: If itâ€™s your first time interpreting events, visit the [Event Interpretation Guide](docs/Interpretation/event-interpretation/overview.md).
2. **Join the Community**: Express your interest by joining our [Discord](https://zapper.xyz/discord) or [Telegram](https://t.me/+mAVxPRsA7bE3ZDkx).

Once you have reviewer access, you will see a new tab called Review under the curate section.
