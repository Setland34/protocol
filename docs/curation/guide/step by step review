## Rejecting an Event

Some events submitted might require to be rejected for different reasons. Here are possible reasons to reject an event interpretation:
- The event has already been interpreted by someone else before <!-- Duplicate -->
- The event needs more details to be complete, and you could not find the details through your research.
- Duplicate from the same user <!-- Some users may sent multiple submissions for the same event if they don't know that one interpretation covers them all -->
- Spam <!-- a user sends multiple interpretations without actually providing info -->
