# How it Works

Your work will start on your Reviewer Dashboard where you will find all pending transactions that await your review. You will find some basic information about each event such as the network the event happened on, brief description of the event, the app as well as who submitted that event. 

Overall, the process of reviewing is pretty simple. (We will get in more details later)

## Where to start

### Identifying Events to Review
####Getting to the reviewer table

Once you get on the curator page, you will notice that the submissions are filtered on Pending. These are the ones you are interested in for now. 
Once you have selected an event you are interested in reviewing, simply click on that event to open up the review page. This is where you get to work! 

Tip! üí° It might be easier to start with events that happened on apps you are familiar with, or some type of transactions that you have yourself made in the past. 

### Reviewing the Event
Once you've opened an event from the reviewer table. On the left side of the review page you will find the event information submitted by the interpreter. Here you can modify, add or remove any of the information submitted. Click on the pen to modify an element, and click on the X to delete an element. You can also modify the action verbs by deleting the text and entering a new one.

On the right side of the page you will find the preview feed that will help you confirm if the event has been correctly interpreted for all events or not. Scroll down to see a total of 12 different events with the same method to make sure everything looks good. 

To help your reviewing, there are some resources available to you to provide additional context:
- The contract address
- The Zapper transaction card
- The chain explorer

Tip! üí° Think of translating without this context as simply asking a generic online translating tool, while getting the context is like asking a native speaker to translate for you! We highly recommend getting a full picture of the event before approving or rejecting. 


## Decision making and step by step diagram

If you feel like the event interpretation is perfect and ready to roll you can go to the bottom of the review page to press ‚ÄúSave and Approve‚Äù. This will confirm the event interpretation and interpret all similar events for everyone to see! How cool is that?!

Some events submitted to you might require to be rejected for different reasons. Here are possible reasons to reject an event interpretation:
- The event has already been interpreted by someone else before. (Duplicate)
- The event needs more details to be complete, and you could not find the details through your research
- Duplicate from the same user (has sent interpretations for similar events)
- Spam (a user sends multiple interpretations without actually providing info)

A final option is that you need to dig further to interpret an event and might need more time to finalize the work. Or maybe you think this event should be reviewed by a different person. In these situations, you also have the option to ‚ÄúPlace on Hold‚Äù this event for future review.
