# Overview

The reviewers or curators are the terms used by Zapper to identify community members that are responsible to approve event interpretation submissions. 

## The role of a reviewer

As a reviewer your role is to confirm that transactions submitted by other community members are accurate, complete and consistent with other similar transactions. This is a super important role since after going through your approval, all similar transactions will be readable, following the logic you approved. 

The reviewer can make adjustments to the Event interpretation to approve it. They also have the ability to reject or put a submission on hold if they feel some information is missing to make an informed decision.
