# Overview

Reviewer the terms used by Zapper to identify community members that are responsible to approve event interpretation submissions.

To be a reviewer, users have to be proficient in event interpretations. Only EI super users can have access to review.

If it’s your first time interpreting events, visit the [Event Interpretation Guide](docs/Interpretation/event-interpretation/overview.md)

If you want to join the reviewer community, jump in the discord or telegram to manifest your interest.

Once you have the reviewer access, you will see a new tab called Review, under the curate section.

## The role of a reviewer

The role of the reviewer is to confirm that transactions submitted by other community members represent what happened onchain.

:::Note
To do so, it has to be accurate, complete and consistent (see Canonical description Terms for standard verbs to use) with other similar transactions.
:::

:::info
This is a super important role since after going through your approval, all similar transactions will be readable, following the logic you approved.
:::

The reviewer can make adjustments to the Event interpretation before approving it. They also have the ability to reject or put a submission on hold if they feel some information is missing to have an accurate representation of what happened.

Once approved, Zap Protocol takes the user’s description and uses it to describe ALL transactions that match:
1. the contract address
2. the method (also referred to as the sighash)
3. the network (as a given contract address can exist on multiple networks)
