# The initial verbâ€‹

The verb describes the action taken by the account that initiated the transaction. Common verbs include deposited, minted, swapped, claimed, borrowed, and bridged. However, these can get more complex if needed, such as Bought a Powershart Pack, Toggled nesting, or Bought a raffle ticket. The main goal is to accurately describe what action was taken in the transaction.

We are aiming to have standards across interpretations, therefore if you hesitate on which word best describes the event, reach out to fellow interpreters and curators on our [Discord channel](https://zapper.xyz/discord) or [Telegram group](https://t.me/+mAVxPRsA7bE3ZDkx).
