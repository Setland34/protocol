# Preview Feed 

When interpreting your transaction, the right side of your screen updates automatically as you input new information. This helps you determine if your interpretations are correct. 

In the screenshot below, two transactions were not interpreted correctly, indicating incorrect or missing details.

This can occur if your interpretation is too specific or if the contract method performs multiple actions. In such cases, you can submit a [conditional event](https://protocol-docs-smoky.vercel.app/docs/Interpretation/event-interpretation/guide/conditionals) by adding a case to the interpretation.

:::warning 

Failed transactions can appear in the preview. You can ignore these transaction cards. To confirm a failed transaction, click on it and check on Zapper or the explorer.
