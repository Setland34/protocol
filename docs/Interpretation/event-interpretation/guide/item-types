**Token transfers:** Any tokens (ERC20 or NFT) entering or leaving a wallet. You can specify the transfer to the “from” account or the “to” account. Filters for ERC20 or NFT can be added. Here is an example of a transaction with a token transfer outflow and inflow:

**NFT Collection:** Will be used to reference a collection address available in the transaction data. The best example is when you approve a collection to be transacted on a marketplace. See example below.

**ERC20 Token:** References a token that did not move. For example, a user can approve a token to be transferred without funds moving.

**Duration:** Refers to a time period, like locking funds for a certain period. The source scale is the contract's duration, and the target scale is how you want to display it (e.g., minutes to months).

You don’t need to use every filter if it's not needed to describe the transaction. For example, filtering on the token transfer standard is optional.

### Transaction fields
**“From” address** - the address the transaction originated by; labeled as “from” on the scanner websites. Looks like this: 0x24CA3B4Be3E9Bd11870B5E065bB367cc1708f06C; could be aliased as an ENS (0xmarc.eth). 

**“To” address** - the address the user is initiating the transaction with; this is always a smart contract, and we assume it is “owned” by an app of some sort, as the app deployed the smart contract. Usually not an ENS.

### Method Parameters

Refers to data in the transaction’s input fields. Only input matching the selected type is shown. To see all input parameter data, open the transaction on the chain explorer and select Decode Input Data.
In the example below, we selected account as the type, we are only seeing the [0] option, cause it’s the only one with an address. [0] refers to the first field in the method bracket, [1] to the second field, [2] to the third, and so on.
