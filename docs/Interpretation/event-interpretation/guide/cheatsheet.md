If you ever feel like you are requiring more info to complete your interpretation, here are a few extra steps that we highly recommend. These will offer more context to the transaction and allow you to finish interepreting your event. 

| **Step**                                   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Example Image**                                 |

| **1. Look at the method name**             | The method name often indicates the action taken. For example, "deposit" usually means the user sent tokens to an app. However, method names can be misleading due to contract forks where names are not updated. Always verify by looking up the transaction on a chain explorer. In the “Input Data” section, you'll find the method name and parameters. <br><br>Zapper Protocol aims to clearly describe the blockchain, so ensure your submissions are accurate!                                                                                                                                                                                   | ![method](/img/assets/methodname.png)             |
| **2. Look at the logs**                    | Event logs provide important transaction details, such as tracking token transfers and decentralized exchange activity. On the explorer, click the “Logs” tab for additional context. <br><br>**Tip:** The first log of the transaction is often used to describe the transaction itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ![logs](/img/assets/logs1.png)                    |
| **3. Look at the input methods**           | Input data can provide specific details, such as the proposal number in a transaction. Without this detail, we might miss important information. <br><br>Example: Instead of a generic “Executed a proposal,” the input data shows the exact proposal number. <br><br>This was possible thanks to the input data of the transaction. See what shows on the explorer: <br><br>![inputdata](/img/assets/inputdata.png)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | ![inputmethod](/img/assets/inputmethod.png)       |
| **4. Find the app related to the transaction/contract** | Identify the app associated with a contract by searching the “TO” address on Google. This can reveal the app owning the contract, providing context for the transaction. <br><br>If that fails, another good way to investigate what app owns a contract is to search it on Github, and look if it is in an app's Github repository. <br><br>[Example search query:](https://github.com/search?q=0x6774Bcbd5ceCeF1336b5300fb5186a12DDD8b367&type=code) <br><br>If additional context is needed, refer to the transaction’s explorer page, accessible from the top right corner of the interpretation page. | ![google](/img/assets/googlesearch.png) <br> ![github](/img/assets/githubsearch.png) <br> ![explorer](/img/assets/explorer.png) |
