# Getting Started

## Where to start

The best place to start is by connecting your wallet on [Zapper](https://zapper.xyz/) and looking at your activity feed. Look for transactions that are rendered as "did something" in the activity tab. We recommend this since understanding the purpose of a transaction can be tricky if you didn't execute it.

Alternatively, you can explore popular transactions on the [Zapper Curate] (https://zapper.xyz/curate/events) page. If you know an app well, interpret multiple transactions from it, as this familiarity helps. Also, if you know an app well, interpret multiple transactions from it, as this familiarity helps.

## Quick example of an Event Interpreter

First, let's assume you have know the transaction's purpose, such as “the user Y sent 6.9 ETH to user X on Farcaster”. Equipped with that knowledge, fill out the transaction using the pre-populated drop-down menus and free-form text boxes.

If you're unsure about the transaction, follow these steps:

- Check the Zapper transaction card for basic information (chain, token transfers, wallet involved etc.)
- Use the explorer for additional details (logs, contract, token movement, accounts, input method parameters etc.)
- Search online for the contract address to see what the app is, this will provide important context (NFT-related app, DeFi app, DEX, lending protocol, etc.)

Above, an example of what interpreting an event looks like before and after.

Once a transaction is interpreted, the description can be used for all events with the same contract method, making thousands of transactions human-readable.

## Event Interpretation video examples

For those who prefer a visual preview to better understand the process of interpreting events, we put together some videos of different types of events you might encounter.
