# Getting Started

## Where to start

### 1. Finding an Event to interpret

The best place to start is by connecting your wallet on [Zapper](https://zapper.xyz/) and looking at your activity feed. Look for transactions that are rendered as "did something" in the activity tab. We recommend this since understanding the purpose of a transaction can be tricky if you didn't execute it.

Alternatively, you can explore popular transactions on the [Zapper Curate](https://zapper.xyz/curate/events) page. If you know an app well, interpret multiple transactions from it, as this familiarity helps. Also, if you know an app well, interpret multiple transactions from it, as this familiarity helps.

### 2. Gathering Information

First, let's assume you have basic knowledge of the transaction's purpose, such as “the user Y sent 6.9 ETH to user X on Farcaster”. Equipped with that knowledge, make sure you go through the next few steps to get a full picture of the transaction. 

- Check the Zapper transaction card for basic information (chain, token transfers, wallet involved etc.)
- Use the explorer for additional details (logs, contract, token movement, accounts, input method parameters etc.)
- Search online for the contract address to see what the app is, this will provide important context (NFT-related app, DeFi app, DEX, lending protocol, etc.)

Once you feel confident that you have a good understanding of what happened, it is now time to [build your event](https://protocol-docs-smoky.vercel.app/docs/Interpretation/event-interpretation/guide/building-event)!
