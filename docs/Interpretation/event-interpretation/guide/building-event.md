# Building an Event
Interpreting an event is simple! There are three areas to fill for an uninterpreted transaction (and not all need to be filled if unnecessary):

1. Decription
2. Item type(s) involved
3. The app through which the transaction occured

Here is where to add each element in the curation tool:

Together, these elements create a standardized format: This **(1)** happened, with these **(2)** items, on that **(3)** app. As shown in the example below.

To create an event, you simply have to combine these three building blocks to interpret the event.
