## Review Process
- **Consistency:** We ensure the verbiage makes sense (e.g., is in the past tense) and is consistent. We may tweak the words or add details.
- **New Apps:** If a new app needs to be created, we’ll add it.
- **Approval:** If all is good, we’ll approve the submission, and your event interpretation will be available to all users.
- **Rejection:** If there are issues, the submission may be rejected with a reason (e.g., duplicate submission, vague action).

## Events not interpreted at this time

- **Multi-sig transactions** - We're working on interpreting these at-scale
