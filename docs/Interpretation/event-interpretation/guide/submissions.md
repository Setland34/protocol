# Submission Process

Once you’ve written your event interpretation, submit it for review. The ReviewerZapper team and community members with a reviewer role will evaluate your submission.

## Review Process:
**Consistency:** We ensure the verbiage makes sense (e.g., is in the past tense) and is consistent. We may tweak the words or add details.
**New Apps:** If a new app needs to be created, we’ll add it.
**Approval:** If all is good, we’ll approve the submission, and your event interpretation will be available to all users.
**Rejection:** If there are issues, the submission may be rejected with a reason (e.g., duplicate submission, vague action).
  
Note that you can monitor the status of your submissions and see rejection reasons in your [My Submissions](https://www.zapper.xyz/my-submissions) page.
