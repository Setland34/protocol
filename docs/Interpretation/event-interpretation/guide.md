# Getting Started

## Where to start

For a lot of transactions, it can be a bit tricky to understand exactly what the purpose of a transaction was, if you are not the one that executed it. 

The best place to start is by searching or connecting your wallet on [Zapper](https://zapper.xyz/) and looking at the activity feed timeline. Start by interpreting any transactions that are rendered as "did something" in the activity tab. 

However, if you're feeling adventurous, you can source popular, uninterpreted transactions from the [Zapper Curate](https://zapper.xyz/curate/events) page.
Another good strategy is to find an app that you know well and that has some associated “did something” transactions. You can interpret multiple transactions from that same app. It helps when you understand how the app works. 

For more details see Tips on how to investigate an Event for interpretation section.

## Event Interpretation mechanics

More often than not, it is super simple to interpret an event! There are 3 different areas to fill in the info for an uninterpreted transaction (and you don’t need to fill in all of them if its not needed)
The areas are:
1. The initial action verb
2. Item type(s) involved
3. The app that this transaction took place through
