# Contribute

If you share Zapper Protocol's mission to make blockchains readable to everyone, you can help this mission by joining our team of contributors! There are two main roles through which you can help Zapper Protocol deliver quality data for consumers. 

1. **Curators** play a key role, they build and maintain interpreters with Zapper Protocol's tools. They are the ones who define the set of instructions that tell Zapper Protocol how to read and interpret onchain information.
Anyone can be an interpreter. You don't need to know how to code to build an interpreter. All you need is knowledge of a particular investment, its smart contract, or what occurred in a given transaction.

2. **Reviewers** are the final layer before data is made available publicly. They review and validate the submissions sent in by Curators and make sure the entire interpretation is correct. Reviewers are a smaller group of contributors made up of experienced Curators who have proven their capacity of delivering accurate data to Zapper Protocol.

## Curator Leaderboard

Some contributors like seeing how many events they have made possible thanks to their interpretations, and track their submissions. You can easily to that with the two links below. 

- You can see how you stack up versus other curators on the [Curator Leaderboard](https://zapper.xyz/curate/leaderboard).
- You can see how many interpreters you have submitted and their stats on your [My Submissions page](https://zapper.xyz/curate/my-submissions).
