# Getting Started

Access the onchain data curated by the Zapper Protocol through a ==Graph QL API==. The endpoints provide complete onchain portfolio data, human-readable transactions, token prices, and more.

## Get an API key

Visit **[protocol.zapper.xyz/dashboard]((https://protocol.zapper.xyz/dashboard))** to get your API key.

## Buy credits

Zapper API uses a credit system to manage how many queries an API key can perform. Each query made costs a certain amount of credits, and these credits are deducted from your credit balance.

You can track your usage and purchase additional credits at **[protocol.zapper.xyz/dashboard]((https://protocol.zapper.xyz/dashboard))**
