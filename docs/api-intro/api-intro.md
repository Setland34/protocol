## Get an API key

Visit the **[Dashboard](/dashboard)** to get your API key.

## Buy credits

Zapper API uses a credit system to manage how many queries an API key can perform. Each query made costs a certain amount of credits, and these credits are deducted from your credit balance.

You can track your usage and purchase additional credits on the API **[Dashboard](/dashboard)**
