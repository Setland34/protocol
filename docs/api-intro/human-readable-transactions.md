# Human-Readable Transactions


Presents onchain activity in a simple descriptive summary including references to dynamic elements of the transaction such as tokens, NFTs, and accounts. Great for use in account histories, social feeds, or app specific feeds.

---

### `accountsTimeline`

The `accountsTimeline` query returns human-readable transactions that offer a descriptive summary of the transaction's details from one or multiple wallets, along with tokens transferred, paginated, chain-agnostic. Typically, a single transaction generates multiple timeline events: one for each wallet impacted by the transaction and one for the associated application, if any.

### Common Uses

##### Onchain Activity Feed

Let's say you want to show users an activity feed for their onchain transactions in a human-readable format with network and app information. You would pass `addresses` for the user and return `processedDescription`, `network`, and `app`. Example of the response below:

```json
{
  "fromUser": {
    "address": "0x52c8ff44260056f896e20d8a43610dd88f05701b",
      "displayName": {
          "value": "0xjasper.eth"
          }
    }

    "interpretation": {
      "processedDescription": "Started battle with sebaudet.eth"
      },
  
      "network": "BASE_MAINNET"

    "app": {
      "name": "Tokiemon",
      },
}
```

:::note
Textual description of each transaction is presented from the perspective of the signer. Events with descriptions such as "Did something with â€¦" indicate that an interpreter for that type of onchain interaction is not available, yet.
