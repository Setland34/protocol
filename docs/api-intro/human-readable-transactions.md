Presents onchain activity in a simple descriptive summary including references to dynamic elements of the transaction such as tokens, NFTs, and accounts. Great for use in account histories, social feeds, or app specific feeds.

### `accountsTimeline`

Returns human-readable transactions that offer a descriptive summary of the transaction's details from one or multiple wallets, along with tokens transferred, paginated, chain-agnostic. Typically, a single transaction generates multiple timeline events: one for each wallet impacted by the transaction and one for the associated application, if any.

:::note
Textual description of each transaction is presented from the perspective of the signer. Events with descriptions such as "Did something with â€¦" indicate that an interpreter for that type of onchain interaction is not available, yet.
