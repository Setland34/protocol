# Human-Readable Transactions


Presents onchain activity in a simple descriptive summary including references to dynamic elements of the transaction such as tokens, NFTs, and accounts. Great for use in account histories, social feeds, or app specific feeds.

---

### `accountsTimeline`

The `accountsTimeline` query returns a descriptive and human-readable summary of the transaction's details from one or multiple wallets, along with tokens transferred, paginated, chain-agnostic. Typically, a single transaction generates multiple timeline events: one for each wallet impacted by the transaction and one for the associated application, if any.

### Example use case: Transaction History

Let's say you want to show users activity for their onchain transactions in a human-readable format with the network it was on and what app was used. You would pass `addresses` for the user and return `processedDescription`, `network`, and the `app` object with `name` and `imgUrl`. Part of the response is show below:

```json
{
  "fromUser": {
    "address": "0x52c8ff44260056f896e20d8a43610dd88f05701b",
      "displayName": {
          "value": "0xjasper.eth"
          }
    }

    "interpretation": {
      "processedDescription": "Started battle with sebaudet.eth"
      },

      "app": {
            "name": "Tokiemon",
            "imgUrl": "https://storage.googleapis.com/zapper-fi-assets/apps%2Ftokiemon.png"
            },

      "network": "BASE_MAINNET"
}
```

:::note
Textual description of each transaction is presented from the perspective of the signer. Events with descriptions such as "Did something with â€¦" indicate that an interpreter for that type of onchain interaction is not available, yet.

### Example Query

```graphql
query($addresses: [Address!]) {
  accountsTimeline(addresses: $addresses) {
    edges {
      node {
        transaction {
          fromUser {
            address
            displayName {
              value
            }
          }
        }
        interpretation {
          processedDescription
        }
         app {
          name
          imgUrl
        }
        network
        }

      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Example Variables

```json
{
  "addresses": [
    "0x52c8ff44260056f896e20d8a43610dd88f05701b",
