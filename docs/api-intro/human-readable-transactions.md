# Human-Readable Transactions


Presents onchain activity in a simple descriptive summary including references to dynamic elements of the transaction such as tokens, NFTs, and accounts. Great for use in account histories, social feeds, or app specific feeds.

---

### `accountsTimeline`

Returns human-readable transactions that offer a descriptive summary of the transaction's details from one or multiple wallets, along with tokens transferred, paginated, chain-agnostic. Typically, a single transaction generates multiple timeline events: one for each wallet impacted by the transaction and one for the associated application, if any.

### Common Uses

An activity feed for a users onchain activity in a human-readable way. The most simple version of this is to pass `addresses` for the user's activity you are want to fetch and return `realtimeInterpretation`.

```json
{
  "interpretation": {
      "processedDescription": "Swapped 0.01 ETH for 372,142.7995 BOTE"
  }

  "interpretation": {
      "processedDescription": "Swapped 0.01 ETH for 372,142.7995 BOTE"
  }

  ...
}
```


An app specific activity feed showing all the in-app actions that users are taking. 



:::note
Textual description of each transaction is presented from the perspective of the signer. Events with descriptions such as "Did something with â€¦" indicate that an interpreter for that type of onchain interaction is not available, yet.
